# Web-Design-Samples
A repository with samples of web design works including HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL files

Keep in mind that not all project files will properly execute CSS, MySQL, or PHP commands due to not being hosted on the original servers the projects were based on or being
located in separate file locations.

These projects are simply code samples that show a demo of my projects, feel free to download and examine them as you please! Most HTML and PHP files should run code
as long as you execute them on the localhost server provided with XAMPP!
